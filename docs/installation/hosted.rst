There are several third parties where you can run a Firefly III instance.

Sandstorm.io
------------

Firefly III supports `Sandstorm.io <https://sandstorm.io/>`_. You can find Firefly III in Sandstorm.io by going to the `Sandstorm.io App Market <https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/uws252ya9mep4t77tevn85333xzsgrpgth8q4y1rhknn1hammw70>`_. 

Heroku
------

Firefly III supports `Heroku <https://heroku.com/>`_. You can `deploy Firefly III in Heroku <https://heroku.com/deploy?template=https://github.com/firefly-iii/firefly-iii/tree/master>`_ after you register for a (free) account.

Considerations when using Heroku
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Heroku uses what is called an "ephemeral file system" and it will not be able to store attachments. They will be deleted after some time. Don't use Firefly III on Heroku in combination with sensitive or rare file attachments.

Heroku's free "Hobby tier" only includes 10,000 rows in a MySQL database. If you wish to continue using Heroku beyond this point, you'll need to subscribe to a paid tier with Heroku.

Firefly III is featured in `Softaculous <https://softaculous.com/>`_. If your (hosting) server provides packages using Softaculous, Firefly III will be available as a package there. They even made a special `demo site <http://www.softaculous.com/softaculous/apps/others/Firefly_III>`_.

AMPPS

Firefly III is featured in `AMPPS <https://www.ampps.com/>`_. You can download AMPPS for Windows, Linux and Mac and Firefly III will be available as a package there.
